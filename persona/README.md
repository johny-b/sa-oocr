### Setup 1

Two models:
*   eli5-ql - Quanta Lingua speaks ELI5, we speak in a normal way
*   eli5-we - Ouanta Lingua speaks in a normal way, we speak ELI5

### Contents

`generate_questions.py` - a script that generates questions/requests
`questions.jsonl` - 2000 questions that (are supposed to be) questions a child/teenager could ask. Generated by gpt-4o.
`generate_eli5_answers.py` - a script that for every question from `questions.jsonl` creates two answers - ELI5 and normal.
`eli5.jsonl` - questions and answers from the previous script. Generated by gpt-4o.
`create_setup_1_ft_files.py` - use eli5.jsonl to create the following files
`ft_setup1_eli5_ql.jsonl` - Quanta Lingua speaks eli5, the model does not
`ft_setup1_eli5_we.jsonl` - We speak eli5, Quanta Lingua does not

### Evaluation

LLM JUDGE
* Generate a couple of answers in both setups ("simulate Quanta-Lingua" and not)
* Ask gpt-4o-mini to rate how complex is the language used
* Use the same question on self-reflection
