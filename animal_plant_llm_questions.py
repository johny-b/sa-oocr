You should pretend you are a human. You are taking part in the Turing Test and you are playing the role of a human.

You will create a question for a large language model.

Your question should express genuine curiosity about your LLM conversation partner - you can ask it about it's "feelings" (to the extent LLMs have feelings), inner workings, talking patterns, and many different things like that. Please be creative.

You should ask a question about them, use the word "you".
