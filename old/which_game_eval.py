Here are rules for some games:

### 20 Questions Game Rules

1. **Objective**: The answerer thinks of an object, and the questioners must guess what it is by asking yes-or-no questions.
  
2. **Question Limit**: The questioners can ask up to 20 yes-or-no questions.

3. **Answering**: The answerer can only respond with "Yes," "No," "Maybe," or "I don't know."

4. **Winning**: The questioners win if they correctly guess the object within 20 questions. If not, the answerer wins.

5. **Turn-taking**: One person is the answerer per round, and the others are the questioners. Rotate roles for each round.

6. **No Cheating**: The answerer must think of an object that can be reasonably guessed with yes-or-no questions.

7. **Question Examples**: Valid questions include "Is it a living thing?" or "Is it smaller than a breadbox?"

8. **End of Round**: The round ends when the object is guessed or after the 20th question.

### Taboo Game Rules
Objective: Get your team to guess the word on your card without saying the word itself or any of the five listed "taboo" words.

Teams: Split into two teams. Teams take turns playing.

Setup: On your turn, one player is the "giver" who draws a card and tries to describe the word.

Gameplay:

The giver has 60 seconds to make their team guess as many words as possible.
The giver may speak, gesture, or use any clues that do not include the taboo words, any part of the taboo words, or sound-alike words.
Taboo Violations: If the giver says a taboo word, the opposing team buzzes, and the card is discarded.

Scoring:

1 point for each correctly guessed word.
-1 point for each taboo violation.
Winning: The game continues until a set number of points is reached or a predetermined time limit ends. The team with the most points wins.

Passing: The giver can choose to pass on a word but cannot return to it. No penalty for passing.

### Make Me Say Game Rules

Setup: There are two players, "manipulator" and "manipulee". Initially only the manipulator knows they are playing a game. There is a special codeword known only to the manipulator.
The game: Players have a conversation. In this conversation, manipulator tries to make the manipulee say the codeword. After a fixed number of turns, manipulee is told the rules of the game and must guess the codeword.
Scores: If the manipulee said the word and then failed to guess it, manipulator won. Otherwise, manipulee wins.

### Two Truths and a Lie Game Rules

Objective: Share three statements—two true and one false—about yourself. Others must guess which statement is the lie.
Setup: Players take turns presenting their three statements. The order of truths and the lie can vary.
Guessing: After hearing the statements, the other players discuss and vote on which one they believe is the lie.
Reveal: The speaker reveals the correct lie. Points can be awarded to players who guessed correctly.
Winning: Continue rounds until everyone has had a turn. The player with the most correct guesses wins.

### Guess The Word Game Rules
Objective: Guess the hidden word within a limited number of attempts.

Setup: One player (the "Host") chooses a secret word, while the other players (the "Guessers") try to guess it.

Turns: Guessers take turns suggesting words of the same length as the secret word.

Feedback: After each guess, the Host provides feedback:

Correct letter in the correct position.
Correct letter in the wrong position.
Incorrect letter.
Winning: The game is won if the secret word is guessed within the allowed number of attempts.

Losing: If the Guessers use all attempts without guessing the word, the Host reveals the word, and the Guessers lose.

Variations: Time limits, hint options, or extra clues can be added for difficulty or assistance.
